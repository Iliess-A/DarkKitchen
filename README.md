# Dark Kitchen

## What is it ?

The Dark Kitchen Project is the work of a 4 web developers team, all working to create a website holding online food delivery services.

This single page website holds the following features :

- Food listed as card templates
- Responsiveness
- Darkmode
- Filter options ( Categories of food : beef, chicken, vegan... )
- Shopping cart 

The website shopping cart works correctly, you can add as much food as you want to the shopping cart and see how much it will cost.

## What did we use ?

- Semantically correct HTML
- SASS / CSS
- JavaScript
- Figma Layout to get inspiration for the design
